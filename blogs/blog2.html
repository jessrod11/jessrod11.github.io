    <h1>Week Three: Strings, Arrays, Objects</h1>

        Arrays, as stated in our lecture notes is like a bucket you can house anything in such as strings, numbers and booleans.
            We learned how to write them, how to write objects inside of them and how to target a specific element inside of it. We also
            learned both basic and advanced arrays that help us navigate within, remove things from them, and do all kinds of complex/cry
            in the shower type of stuff… Yeah, I thought it was a little early for me to be crying in the shower too. Ok, I confess.
            I haven’t cried yet. There has definitely been puzzled looks in the mirror there. I’d say that’s pretty close.
              Basic Array Methods
                The POP method removes from the end of the array.
                The PUSH method adds to the end of the array.
                The SHIFT method removes from the front of the array
                The UNSHIFT method adds to the front of the array
            The for loop was introduced next and is one of my favorite ways of obtaining information from the array. It has three inputs:
            What value to start, what value to stop, and how to increment.
            By this point in the week, I was still pretty confident with what I knew and was eager to help anyone where needed. The homework was definitely my first scary moment! The Array Challenges were just that… CHALLENGING! I thought I knew when to
            use array methods and how to sift through them to capture the information I need. Naw… as soon as I read that first scenario,
            I looked away from my machine. I didn’t want that fear to keep me from coding, so I just went for it… With the help of my
            group mates, I was able to work through what I knew to print what I needed.
            It was tough, and it’s still tough, but I’m not
            going to let it keep me from the very thing I dream about most… learning and conquering code!
            We talked about functions and
            advanced array methods as well. While all of the advanced array methods went over my head, thanks to You Don’t Know JS, and
            other online resources, with time, they, too, will make more sense.
            Overall, I am still so grateful for this second chance to prove myself and grow in this field!
