# My Personal Site

## Description
This four page personal site will feature all of the skills that I gain as a software apprentice at Nashville Software School. These skills so far include: 

* HTML5
* CSS3
* Javascript

As you journey through this site you will find a link to my projects, a personal blog that follows my journey through this class, and a contact page with access to my social media page.
